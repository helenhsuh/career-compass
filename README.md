Career Compass — AI‑Assisted Career Transition Tool
A conceptual machine learning project exploring how AI can support equitable, human‑centered career transitions.

📌 Overview
Career Compass is a conceptual AI/ML project designed to help people navigate career transitions by identifying aligned roles, transferable skills, and realistic pathways based on their background, values, and real‑life constraints.
This project reflects my lived experience supporting young adults, mid‑career professionals, and individuals balancing dependents, caregiving responsibilities, or lifestyle limitations. It also represents my early technical exploration into embeddings, clustering, NLP, and responsible model design.
This repository documents my thinking, research, and structured approach to building an inclusive, ethical, and human‑centered AI system — even as I continue developing my technical skills.

🎯 Project Goals
• 	Support users navigating career transitions at any life stage
• 	Translate skills, experiences, and constraints into actionable pathways
• 	Explore how AI can provide transparent, ethical recommendations
• 	Build foundational understanding of ML workflows, including:
• 	Data preparation
• 	Feature considerations
• 	Embeddings
• 	Clustering
• 	NLP for interpreting user inputs
• 	Evaluation thinking

🧠 Why This Project Matters
Career decisions shape financial stability, family well‑being, and long‑term opportunity. Many people — especially mid‑career adults — face constraints such as:
• 	Dependents
• 	Caregiving responsibilities
• 	Limited relocation flexibility
• 	Financial pressures
• 	Skill gaps
• 	Burnout or career stagnation
Career Compass is designed to acknowledge these realities and offer guidance that is practical, empathetic, and grounded in real‑world constraints.

Each notebook is conceptual and focuses on reasoning, structure, and methodology, not production‑ready code.

🛠️ Technical Concepts Explored
1. Data Preparation
• 	Identifying relevant inputs: skills, work history, values, constraints
• 	Structuring user profiles
• 	Mapping skills to standardized taxonomies
2. Feature Considerations
• 	Skill similarity
• 	Transferability
• 	Constraints (dependents, caregiving, relocation, finances)
• 	Values and work preferences
3. Embeddings (Foundational)
• 	How embeddings represent skills and roles
• 	Why similarity matters in career recommendations
4. Clustering (Foundational)
• 	Grouping similar roles
• 	Identifying patterns in career trajectories
5. NLP (Foundational)
• 	Interpreting user inputs
• 	Extracting skills and preferences from text
6. Evaluation Thinking
• 	Fairness
• 	Transparency
• 	Usability
• 	Avoiding over‑confidence in recommendations

🤝 My Contributions
This is an independent project. I contributed to:
• 	Problem definition
• 	Research and conceptual design
• 	Data schema and feature planning
• 	Exploration of embeddings, clustering, and NLP
• 	Ethical framework
• 	Documentation and roadmap

📈 Challenges & What I Learned
• 	Translating human complexity into structured data
• 	Understanding how embeddings capture similarity
• 	Thinking through fairness and transparency
• 	Balancing technical ambition with beginner‑level skills
• 	Designing for users with real‑world constraints
This project strengthened my ability to think like an engineer: breaking down problems, structuring solutions, documenting assumptions, and planning next steps.

🚀 Next Steps
If I continue this project, I plan to:
• 	Build a prototype recommendation engine
• 	Integrate real career trajectory datasets
• 	Test with users across life stages
• 	Evaluate model performance and fairness
• 	Explore explainability techniques
