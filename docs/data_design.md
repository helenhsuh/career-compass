# Data Design

Since no real dataset was available, this document outlines the schema and data preparation steps that would be required for real development.

## Data Sources (Planned)
- Job descriptions
- Skill taxonomies
- Career pathways
- Salary ranges
- Location-based constraints

## Schema Design
- job_id
- role_title
- required_skills
- preferred_skills
- experience_level
- responsibilities
- salary_range
- location
- role_family

## Cleaning Steps
- Standardize skill names
- Remove duplicates
- Normalize text
- Label fields consistently
