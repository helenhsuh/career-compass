# Ethical Considerations

Career Compass is grounded in the belief that AI should support—not replace—human decision-making. Because career decisions affect financial stability, family well-being, and long-term opportunity, ethical considerations are central to this project.

## Fairness
Users come from diverse backgrounds and life stages. Recommendations must:
- Avoid reinforcing existing inequities
- Consider constraints such as caregiving, dependents, or relocation limits
- Provide options that are realistic and accessible

## Transparency
Users should understand:
- Why certain roles are recommended
- What features influenced the recommendation
- What assumptions the system makes

## Privacy
Career data is deeply personal. Any future implementation must:
- Minimize data collection
- Use anonymized or synthetic datasets for prototyping
- Provide clear consent and data usage explanations

## Safety
Incorrect or overly confident recommendations can harm users. The system must:
- Avoid deterministic language
- Present multiple pathways
- Encourage human judgment and reflection

## Responsible Use of AI
Career Compass is designed to augment human insight, not dictate decisions. The system should empower users to explore possibilities while maintaining agency and autonomy.
