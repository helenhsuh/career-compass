# Career Compass — Project Overview

Career Compass is a conceptual AI/ML system designed to help users navigate career transitions by identifying aligned roles, transferable skills, and realistic pathways based on their background, values, and real-life constraints. The project reflects my lived experience supporting young adults and mid-career adults through career decisions, as well as my growing technical foundation in data analysis, NLP, embeddings, and clustering.

## Purpose
Career transitions are deeply personal and often shaped by factors such as dependents, caregiving responsibilities, financial limitations, relocation constraints, burnout, or identity shifts. Many tools focus on job matching without acknowledging these realities. Career Compass aims to provide guidance that is practical, empathetic, and grounded in real-world constraints.

## Core Questions
- How can AI help users understand their transferable skills?
- How can embeddings and clustering reveal patterns in career trajectories?
- How can NLP interpret user inputs in a way that feels intuitive and supportive?
- How can recommendations remain ethical, transparent, and aligned with user values?

## System Components
- **User Profile Inputs:** skills, work history, values, constraints, personality traits, learning preferences.
- **Feature Extraction:** identifying relevant attributes from structured and unstructured inputs.
- **Embeddings:** representing skills and roles in vector space to measure similarity.
- **Clustering:** grouping similar roles and identifying potential pathways.
- **NLP:** interpreting user descriptions and extracting meaningful features.
- **Recommendation Logic:** generating aligned roles, learning paths, and next steps.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Structured problem-solving
- Early ML reasoning
- Human-centered design
- Ethical awareness
- Documentation and planning
- Ability to break down complex systems into components

This project is ongoing and will evolve as I deepen my technical skills.
