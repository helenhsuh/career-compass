# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of Career Compass as my technical skills grow.

## Phase 1: Conceptual Design (Completed)
- Problem definition
- User personas
- Ethical framework
- Feature planning
- ML approach exploration

## Phase 2: Prototype Foundations (Upcoming)
- Create synthetic dataset for skills and roles
- Implement basic embeddings using open-source models
- Explore clustering to identify role patterns
- Build simple NLP pipeline for parsing user inputs

## Phase 3: Recommendation Engine (Future)
- Combine embeddings + clustering + constraints
- Generate role recommendations
- Provide learning path suggestions
- Add explainability components

## Phase 4: Evaluation & Testing (Future)
- Define evaluation metrics (fairness, usability, clarity)
- Conduct user testing with diverse personas
- Iterate based on feedback

## Phase 5: Ethical & Practical Refinement (Future)
- Add transparency features
- Improve constraint handling
- Document limitations and responsible use guidelines

This roadmap will evolve as I deepen my engineering skills.
